# Contoso University Blazor - Authenticated
A fork of my ContosoUniversityBlazorExtended project meant for further experimentation with Authentication/Authorization.

This project is based off the [Contoso University](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/data/ef-mvc/intro?view=aspnetcore-8.0) example from Microsoft.
It has been adapted to Clean Architecture based off the [Clean Architecture solution template](https://github.com/jasontaylordev/CleanArchitecture) from Jason Taylor as an API using CQRS with a Blazor WASM front-end.

The solution contains the following projects:

| Project        | Are           |
| ------------- |:-------------:| 
| col 3 is      | right-aligned | 
| col 2 is      | centered      | 
| zebra stripes | are neat      |
